# Student Success Predictor using Naive Bayes

![Naive Bayes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Implementation-Naive%20Bayes-red)

Welcome to the Student Success Predictor project! This implementation utilizes Naive Bayes to estimate the probability of a student scoring above 90 in examinations based on various parameters such as hours of study, wakeup time, handwriting, and language fluency.

## Overview

- **model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the Naive Bayes model. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using the specified parameters.

## Parameters Used

1. **Hours of Study**: The number of hours a student dedicates to studying.
2. **Wakeup Time**: The time the student wakes up in the morning.
3. **Handwriting**: Evaluation of handwriting quality.
4. **Language Fluency**: Proficiency in language.

## How to Use

1.Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AHBRIJESH/Naive_Bayes_Algorithm.git
   Naive_Bayes_Algorithm.git
   ```
2.  Open and run the cells in `model.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Input the required parameters: Hours of Study, Wakeup Time, Handwriting, and Language Fluency.
4. The model will predict the probability of the student scoring above 90 in examinations.


## Project Structure

- **/data**: Contains sample datasets for testing the model.
- **/images**: Holds relevant images or plots generated during analysis.
- **model.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook for the Naive Bayes implementation.
- **README.md**: The project's documentation.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by opening issues, providing suggestions, or submitting pull requests. Let's collaborate to enhance the accuracy and usability of the Student Success Predictor!
